An independent mercenary captain waits in the Opis belt, musing on their bounty. It claims to be from the ARC: a hit on the Diktat's prize superweapon project as it returns from testing. The short notice, high price, and contingencies requiring salvage and return of gunnery computer cores, however, seem out of place. It has Tri-Tachyon's mark all over it, but a hit this sensitive wouldn't have been farmed out to whoever's closest unless they had no contingency plans. Maybe, they muse, there's a second payday in this. A rival exec would love to pass this to Operational Security...

The captain of the LGS Lion's Roar burns towards Volturn. Tests on the new Energy Bolt Coherer went well, but the post-firing telemetry transmission seems to have glitched. Time to return to dock, and get the techs to run through the systems.
