toaster_conquest2_lg,SHIP,"Though named the Triumph-class by the Sindran Diktat, this retrofit of the Conquest-class Battlecruiser is colloquially referred to as the Conquest Mk. II. An early exemplar of the Diktat's 'decisive strike' doctrine, it combines respectable speed with a powerful first-strike capacity.

Not a 'true' nanoforge blueprint, the class is a retrofitting of locally-produced hulls with weaponry salvaged from Onslaught-class Battleships; originally those wrecked during the Askonia Crisis, or decommissioned in its aftermath as symbols of the Hegemony. An effective tool in the early days of the Diktat, weak performance against Capital-grade opposition led to the development of the Executor, and the class is now considered end-of-life.",,,
